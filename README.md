# Back-end Booking Clone

This project was developed as a way to apply my current subject of study. It was made using .NET Core, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and SQL Server as a database.

I developed this project during my studies in web development at Trybe.

Everything is set up to make it deployment-ready, and it has been previously deployed using Railway. However, I deliberately took it down to prevent unnecessary expenses.
